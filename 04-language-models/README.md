_(We're going to cover more about LLMs and AI in future weeks, but here we'll just dip our toe in the water and test LLMs in JS to compare and contrast with markov chains and grammars)_

## Assignment

- Read [Language models can only write ransom notes](https://posts.decontextualize.com/language-models-ransom-notes/) by Allison Parrish

Choose one (or more!) of the following approaches to explore computational text generation. As you experiment, consider Parrish's discussion of "cuts" in collage, the difference between "collections" and "hoards," and how different computational methods make visible (or obscure) their source materials and processes.

_(It is not required to write any new code for this assignment. You are welcome to run one or more of the provided examples with your own data. You can document the results in a blog post (or link to a web page where the text is generated). I'll include some other ideas below in case you are feeling ambitious.)_

### Markov Chains

Use one of the [existing examples](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/collections/WEXEPRHuE) to generate text with your own input data. Experiment with the "order" and "maximum" length variables. Try mixing multiple texts. Copy paste your favorite outputs from the browser and document in a blog post.

It is not required to write any new code for this assignment, however I'll include some ideas for further exploration below.

- Design a webpage that displays the output of a markov generator a la [Allison Parrish's ITP course creator](http://static.decontextualize.com/toys/next_semester).
- Create a bot that generates its output based on a markov chain.
- Use a markov chain on something other than text. Record your own sequence of daily habits. Try musical notes. Could colors or shapes be generated with a markov chain? What else? You can find examples for [musical markov chains](https://luisaph.github.io/the-code-of-music-2018/#Markov) from Luisa Pereira's [Code of Music materials](https://luisaph.github.io/the-code-of-music-2018/).
- Thinking back to [the word counting material](https://github.com/shiffman/A2Z-F26/tree/main/02-word-counting), visualize n-gram frequencies and/or markov probabilities.

### Context-Free Grammars

Invent your own grammar and generate text. You can use [Tracery](http://tracery.io/), [any of my examples](https://editor.p5js.org/a2zitp/collections/5IFiJuQZa), or try [RiGrammer](https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/grammar/index.html) from the RiTa library.

Getting results from a context-free-grammar can be tricky. Short and sweet, highly structured ideas tend to work well. For example.

- A coffee drink order generator.
- An apology generator.
- An ITP project idea generator.
- A knock knock joke generator.

Something you might consider is pulling the "terminal" words for your grammar from an API or other data source. You are also welcome to explore generative visual art basing your exercise off of the L-System material described above. Or what else can you generate from a Context-Free Grammar? Music?

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

Experiment with running a small language model locally in the browser using [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/) and [SmolLM 3](https://github.com/huggingface/smollm). Consider how this approach compares to Markov chains and context-free grammars in terms of Parrish's concepts of "cuts," materiality, and the visibility of source materials.
